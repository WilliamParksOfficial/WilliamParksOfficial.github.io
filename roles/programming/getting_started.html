        <h2>Installing Android Studio</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Begin by installing
          <a
            href="https://developer.android.com/studio"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Android Studio</a
          >. This is our <span class="vocab">Development Environment</span>.
          This means that it is an app that we'll be writing our code in.
          Default installation settings are recommended.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting up GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Next we'll need to create a
          <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >GitHub</a
          >
          account. However, DO NOT use your school email address. You need to
          use a personal email address, as many school email addresses block the
          GitHub verification email. This is very important, as GitHub is what
          we use to collaborate with each other on a single
          <span class="vocab">repository</span> (project), as well as
          <span class="vocab">fork</span> (make a copy of) the starting FTC
          repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;In addition to its collaboratibe features, GitHub is a very
          useful tool due to the fact that all repositories use a version
          control system called <span class="vocab">Git</span>, meaning that you
          can <span class="vocab">commit</span> (save) your work at any time to
          create a checkpoint, as well as revert your repository to the state of
          any previous commits. Visit the
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Git Website</a
          >
          to learn more.
        </p>
        <h2>Create Project</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Now we need to create the GitHub repository that we'll be using
          for our project. If someone on your team already has a GitHub
          repository for this purpose, ask them to add you as a collaborator,
          and skip to the "Connecting GitHub to Android Studio" section
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Otherwise, go to the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >FtcRobotController</a
          >
          GitHub repository, and make sure you are signed into your GitHub
          account. Then, click the
          <span class="vocab">fork</span> button in the upper right hand corner
          of the page. This will create a copy that you can edit. Here you will
          be able to select the name and description. You may leave the name as
          the default, and leave the description blank, but this is unimportant.
        </p>
        <h2>Connecting GitHub to Android Studio</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Next we need to connect our GitHub account to Android Studio so
          that we can easily <span class="vocab">push</span> our changes to the
          online GitHub repository from our development environment so that our
          collaborators can see our changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;The first step to accomplish this is generating a
          <span class="vocab">Personal Access Token</span> on GitHub. To do so,
          go to your profile picture on the top right hand corner of GitHub, and
          click on settings in the dropdown menu. Next, find Developer Settings
          in the sidebar, and click Personal Access Tokens followed by Generate
          New Token. Finally, enter a note like "Connect GitHub to Android
          Studio", set the expiration to no expiration, and check the checkboxes
          for all permissions. This should generate a series of random
          characters that you need to copy.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Now, in Android Studio, select Get from VCS on the Projects
          page, and click GitHub on the sidebar. Now you'll be presented with
          two options, and you MUST select Use token, as the Log In via GitHub
          option is not functional at the time of writing. Next, you simply need
          to paste the token you copied, and click Log In. Now you should be
          presented with all of your GitHub repositories, and you need to select
          FtcRobotController (or whatever you named your repository) and hit the
          <span class="vocab">Clone</span> button. If it asks you if you would
          like to Trust the project, accept.
        </p>
        <h2>Finishing Up</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Now you should be inside of your project, where you'll be able
          to see the progress of various downloading and indexing tasks at the
          bottom of your screen. You'll need to wait for these to be completed
          before you begin coding. However, you may get various pop-ups while
          these are downloading that tell you that something in your project can
          be upgraded, but DO NOT accept. The project was created to work with
          very specific versions of each tool, and upgrading these could cause
          problems down the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;If you face any other problems, start by troubleshooting for
          yourself and researching your problem, but you may also email
          emmett.lach@gmail.com. However, if all downloading and indexing is
          completed without any problems, your development environment is ready,
          and you may move on to the next section.
