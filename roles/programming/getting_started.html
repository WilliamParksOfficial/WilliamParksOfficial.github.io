        <h2>Installing Android Studio</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Begin by installing
          <a
            href="https://developer.android.com/studio"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Android Studio</a
          >. This is our <span class="vocab">Development Environment</span>.
          This means that it is an app that we'll be writing our code in.
          Default installation settings are recommended.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting up GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Next you'll need to create a
          <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >GitHub</a
          >
          account. However, DO NOT use your school email address. You need to
          use a personal email address, as many school email addresses block the
          GitHub verification email. This is very important, as GitHub is what
          we use to collaborate with each other on a single
          <span class="vocab">repository</span> (project), as well as
          <span class="vocab">fork</span> (make a copy of) the starting FTC
          repository.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its collaboratibe features, GitHub is a very useful
          tool due to the fact that all repositories use a version control
          system called <span class="vocab">Git</span>, meaning that you can
          <span class="vocab">commit</span> (save) your work at any time to
          create a checkpoint, as well as revert your repository to the state of
          any previous commits. Visit the
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Git Website</a
          >
          to learn more.
        </p>
        <h2>Create Project</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp;Now we need to create the GitHub repository that we'll be using
          for our project. If someone on your team already has a GitHub
          repository for this purpose, ask them to add you as a collaborator,
          and skip to the "Connecting GitHub to Android Studio" section
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;Otherwise, go to the
          <a
            href="https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >FtcRobotController</a
          >
          GitHub repository, and make sure you are signed into your GitHub
          account. Then, click the
          <span class="vocab">fork</span> button in the upper right hand corner
          of the page. This will create a copy that you can edit. Here you will
          be able to select the name and description. You may leave the name as
          the default, and leave the description blank, but this is unimportant.
